My solutions to select exercises in 
"The C Programming Language 2nd Edition" by Kernighan and Ritchie (AKA "the K&R").

All are verified to compile in gcc 3.4.4 (in Cygwin) with -Wall without any warnings or errors.

More solutions will be added as they are reviewed and tested, and as time permits.
